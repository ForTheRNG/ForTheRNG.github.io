THIS PAGE DOES NOT WORK YET, SORRY

For a subscription, take the URL of the book (placeholder example that probably links to nothing:
https://archiveofourown.org/works/1234567890), cut the starting bit (so you end up with something like
/works/1234567890) and put it after this page's link (like .github.io/ao3-rss/works/1234567890); when
this page works, it'll return an RSS feed of the last 10 chapters.
