THIS PAGE DOES NOT WORK YET, SORRY <br><br>

For a subscription, take the URL of the book (placeholder example that probably links to nothing:
https://archiveofourown.org/works/1234567890/), cut the starting bit (so you end up with something like
works/1234567890/) and put it after this page's link with a question mark (like
[insert-username].github.io/ao3-rss?works/1234567890/); when this page works, it'll return an RSS feed
of the last 10 chapters.
